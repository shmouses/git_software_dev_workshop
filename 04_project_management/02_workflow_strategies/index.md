# Git Workflow Strategies

Learn about different Git workflow strategies and how to choose the right one for your project.

## Common Workflow Strategies

### 1. Centralized Workflow

- Single central repository
- All developers work on main branch
- Simple but limited collaboration

### 2. Feature Branch Workflow

- Feature branches for development
- Pull requests for code review
- Protected main branch

### 3. Gitflow Workflow

- Development and production branches
- Feature, release, and hotfix branches
- Strict branching model

### 4. Forking Workflow

- Each developer has their own fork
- Pull requests to main repository
- Common in open source

## Workflow Implementation

### 1. Branch Naming

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration

# Bug fixes
bugfix/login-error
bugfix/checkout-crash

# Releases
release/v1.0.0
release/v2.0.0
```

### 2. Branch Protection

```bash
# GitHub branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks
- Require linear history
- Include administrators
```

### 3. Release Management

```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0

# Tag releases
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## CI/CD Integration

### 1. Continuous Integration

- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Build verification
- Security scanning

### 2. Continuous Deployment

- Automated deployment
- Environment management
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring

## Best Practices

1. Choose workflow based on team size
2. Document workflow clearly
3. Automate repetitive tasks
4. Regular workflow reviews
5. Adapt as needed

## Practice Exercises

1. Set up branch protection
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline
3. Create release workflow
4. Implement code review process
5. Document workflow
