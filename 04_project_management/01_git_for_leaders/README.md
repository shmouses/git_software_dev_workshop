# Git for Project Leaders and Product Managers

## Understanding Git from a Management Perspective

As a project leader or product manager, understanding Git workflows and best practices is crucial for:
- Managing team productivity
- Ensuring code quality
- Planning releases
- Tracking project progress

## Git Workflows for Different Project Types

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow
- Best for: Small to medium teams
- Characteristics:
  - Each feature has its own branch
  - Clean main/master branch
  - Regular merges to main

### 2. GitFlow Workflow
- Best for: Large projects with scheduled releases
- Characteristics:
  - Development and release branches
  - Hotfix branches for urgent fixes
  - Structured release process

### 3. Trunk-Based Development
- Best for: Continuous deployment
- Characteristics:
  - Short-lived feature branches
  - Frequent commits to main
  - Automated testing

## Managing Releases

### Release Planning
1. **Version Control**
   - Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Release branches
   - Release tags

2. **Release Process**
```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0

# Make release-specific changes
git commit -m "Prepare for release v1.0.0"

# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Merge to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.0.0
git checkout develop
git merge release/v1.0.0

# Delete release branch
git branch -d release/v1.0.0
```

## Project Management Best Practices

### 1. Branch Naming Conventions
```
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-error
hotfix/security-patch
release/v1.0.0
```

### 2. Commit Message Standards
```
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Resolve login page error
docs: Update API documentation
style: Format code according to guidelines
```

### 3. Code Review Guidelines
- Pull request templates
- Review checklists
- Automated checks

## Tools for Project Management

### 1. GitHub Projects
- Kanban boards
- Milestone tracking
- Issue management

### 2. Git Hooks
- Pre-commit checks
- Automated testing
- Code quality gates

### 3. CI/CD Integration
- Automated builds
- Test automation
- Deployment pipelines

## Managing Team Collaboration

### 1. Access Control
- Repository permissions
- Branch protection rules
- Code review requirements

### 2. Documentation
- README files
- Contributing guidelines
- Release notes

### 3. Communication
- Pull request templates
- Issue templates
- Team guidelines

## Exercise: Setting Up a Project

1. **Initialize Project Structure**
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Initialize Git
git init

# Create initial structure
mkdir src tests docs
touch README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
```

2. **Set Up Branch Protection**
- Configure branch protection rules
- Set up required reviewers
- Enable status checks

3. **Create Project Templates**
- Issue templates
- Pull request templates
- Release notes template

## Leadership Responsibilities

### 1. Code Quality
- Establish coding standards
- Set up automated checks
- Monitor code quality metrics

### 2. Team Productivity
- Streamline workflows
- Remove bottlenecks
- Provide training and resources

### 3. Project Health
- Monitor repository metrics
- Track team velocity
- Address technical debt
